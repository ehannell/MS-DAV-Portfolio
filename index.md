### About the project
This research paper constitutes the final project in the **Data Analysis** class. The purpose of the project was to investigate whether it would be possible to discern public attitude toward the electrical vehicle company, Tesla, by analyzing data from Twitter, and also explore whether correlating patterns between the sentiment extracted from tweets and the share price of the company. Sentiment swings were evident upon the completion of the data analysis, but determining share price correlation would require further statistical analysis, which falls outside the scope of this project.   

### Method
I started with building a Python script using the twitteR-module, which allowed me to scrape tweet data from Twitter. Once the connection had been set up and I had defined certain keywords and criteria for defining what tweets I wanted to collect, I organized all the information into a large dataset. I imported the dataset into R, where I used the NRC-library to analyze the sentiment of each tweet. A new column was created, holding a positivity score for each tweet based on the NRC output. This column was used to determine the public sentiment toward Tesla over time. 

### Learning Outcome
Not only did I learn the fundamentals of data analysis, especially the analysis of text-based data, but this project also improved my ability to conduct and convey data-driven research. Furthermore, I gained experience in developning complex research questions and how to choose appropriate analytical methods for approaching those questions.

# PROJECT 2: COVID-19 - Stock Market Impact Analysis

- **Class:** Advanced Projects
- **Expertise:** Technology
- **Link to project:** [COVID-19 - Stock Market Impact Analysis](https://ehannell.github.io/covid19_sp500/)

### About the project
This interactive data visualization website is was built for the **Advanced Projects** class. The website consists of 6 different interactive data visualizations which show information about the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the stock market, during the first 2-months of the virus outbreak. The purpose of the project was to make a platform that could be used by various users, regardless of financial market knowledge, to explore how the pandemic made an impact on the world economy.

### Method
The website was built from scratch in Github and hosted as a Github page. The website design was kept minimalistic, with the resemblance of a report. The data used for the visualization was derived from John Hopkins University (COVID-19 cases) and Yahoo Finance (financial data). I created the interactive charts using the Altair module in Python. The charts were exported as HTML code and integrated to the website, allowing users to easily explore the information.  

### Learning Outcome
In addition to increased knowledge of working manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in Python, this project was very educational in regard to technical capability. I learned to go from having several raw datasets to offering an interactive and informational view of that data on a website. The technologies that I learned to use in this project will prove essential for future projects relating to analyzing and visualizing data in a user-friendly and accessible way.

# PROJECT 3: Amazon - A Look at the World's Highest Valued Company 

- **Class:** Information Visualization
- **Expertise:** Communication
- **Link to project:** [Amazon - Company Dashboard Presenation](https://github.com/ehannell/dav_portfolio/blob/main/Amazon%20-%20a%20look%20at%20the%20world's%20highest%20valued%20company.pdf)

### About the project
This project, which was created for the **Information Visualization** class, is a visual presentation of the company Amazon Inc. Four Tableau dashboards are used to convey information found in the annual report, but also data from other sources, such as public sentiment derived by scraping and analyzing Twitter data.  

### Method
The initial phase of the project consisted of several design and brainstorming exercises to decide on a dashboard format that would be efficient in communicating information to the user. After deciding on a structure, I carefully selected types of visualizations that best delivered the information. These steps eventually resulted in five different dashboards, starting with size comparison to show just how large Amazon is, followed by three dashboards holding annual report information, and finally a dashboard page to show the public perception of Amazon. On the last page, I also embedded a Wikipedia page to make it possible for the user to quickly learn about company criticism.    

### Learning Outcome
This project helped me improve my ability to deliver various types of information by communicating through information visualizations. I learned how certain graphs are more suitable in conveying the underlying data, as well as how to set up the visualizations logically to help the user understand the information. Furthermore, I was able to implement the skills learned from other classes to further improve this information visualization project. For instance, I used the Python script used in the [research project](#project-1-sentiment-analysis) to analyze the public perception of Amazon.

# PROJECT 4: Thought Paper - How the Information Explosion is Disrupting Traditional Business Strategy

- **Class:** Foundations of Information
- **Expertise:** Critical Perspectives
- **Link to project:** [Thought Paper](https://github.com/ehannell/dav_portfolio/blob/main/Foundations%20of%20Information%20-%20Thought%20Paper%20(ehannell).pdf)

![](https://i.ibb.co/C2pb8N9/thoughtpaper.jpg)

### About the project
This thought paper stands out as the least technical compared to the other projects in this portfolio. It was written as part of the **Foundations of Information** class and seeks to explore how the information explosion of the past several decades have disrupted traditional business strategy. Coming into this master's program with a background in business, I wanted to better understand how information technology have changed businesses that predate these new technological innovations.      

### Method
The thought paper is largely based on a Ted-talk by Philip Evans, the founder of the media and internet division of the global firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG). In his presentation, “How data will transform business”, Evans provides reflections very much aligned with my paper's topic. In addition to Evans’s Ted-talk, I used scholarly articles that we read in class, historical data, and other expert statements to yield support for the ideas presented in the paper.

### Learning Outcome
In writing this paper I learned to think critically about how constant and immediate information access shapes our society. Throughout the Foundation of Information class, we studied the information explosion's impact, for better or worse, in various areas of society. By applying the critical thinking skills gained during the course, I was able to gain a better understanding of those impacts within business strategy, a professional area that I envision myself navigating in my career.

# PROJECT 5: User Testing Report - Socialsolar Mobile Platform

- **Class:** Usability Theory & Practice
- **Expertise:** User-Centered Design
- **Link to project:** [User Testing Report](https://github.com/ehannell/dav_portfolio/blob/main/Socialsolar.pdf)

![](https://i.ibb.co/t3BY97G/userdesign.png)

### About the project
This project was a group project carried out in the **Usability Theory & Practice class**. Our group was responsible for delivering a UX-design report, consisting of analysis, findings, and recommendations, to the New York-based company Social Solar, who was our client during the project. The report was focused on user testing, meaning that we - the researchers - analyzed a group of individuals while they were using Social Solar's online platform. This user analysis generate was used to come up with findings and recommendations to support Social Solar in their UX design strategy.    

### Method
As mentioned above, we analyzed individuals as they were using Social Solar's online platform. However, before the actual user testing part of the project, a lot of preparations were made. We carefully designed the user session to make sure that our users interact with the platform as they normally would in a real-world setting. This entailed, for instance, designing questions that the user would have to answer based on information that could be found somewhere on Social Solar's website. After the user testing we gathered all data that we had collected, and used that information to deliver design recommendations to our client - ultimately to improve the usability of their platform. 

#### My role
In addition to generating one of our recommendations, I was responsible for developing our participant forms, which contained the user directions during the user test sessions. I was also in charge of data analysis and compiling our data so that it could be shared with our client in the report appendix.  

### Learning Outcome
This was a very educational project, as I learned how to design user testing sessions that could emulate real-world scenarios while providing a lot of useful data. I also learned how to redesign digital platforms in a way that would make them easier to use and certain functions easier to understand. Furthermore, our group gained real-world experience in that we worked with an actual external client, that would use our recommmendations to improve their platform.
