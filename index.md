- [Research](#project-1-sentiment-analysis)
- [Technology](#project-2-covid-19---stock-market-impact-analysis)
- [Communication](#project-3-amazon---a-look-at-the-worlds-highest-valued-company)

- [User-Centered Design](#project-5-user-testing-report---socialsolar-mobile-platform)


# PROJECT 1: Sentiment Analysis

- **Class:** Data Analysis
- **Expertise:** Research
- **Link to project:** [Sentiment Analysis for Investment Research](https://github.com/ehannell/dav_portfolio/blob/main/Final%20Project%20-%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Investment%20Research%20(Erik%20Hannell).pdf)

### About the project
This research paper was created for the final project in the data analysis class. The purpose of the paper was to investigate whether it would be possible to discern public attitude toward Tesla by analyzing data from Twitter. 

### Method
I started with building a Python script using the twitteR-module, which allowed me to scrape tweet data from Twitter. Once the connection had been set up and I had defined certain key words and criteria for defining what tweets I wanted to collect, I organized all the information into a large dataset. I imported the dataset into R, where I used the NRC-library to analyze the sentiment of each tweet. A new column was created, holding a positivity score for each tweet based on the NRC output. This column was used to determine the public sentiment toward Tesla over time. 

### Learning Outcome
Not only did I learn the fundamentals of data analysis, especially analysis of text based data, but this project also improved my ability to conduct and convey data driven research. Furthermore, I gained experience in developnig complex research questions and how to choose appropriate analytical methods for approaching those questions.    

# PROJECT 2: COVID-19 - Stock Market Impact Analysis

- **Class:** Advanced Projects
- **Expertise:** Technology
- **Link to project:** [COVID-19 - Stock Market Impact Analysis](https://ehannell.github.io/covid19_sp500/)

### About the project
This interative data visaulziation website is was built for the advanced projects class. The website consists of 6 different interactive data visualizations which shows information about the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the stock market, during the first 2-months of the virus outbreak. The purpose of the project was to make a platform that could be used by various users, regardless of financial market knowledge, to explore how the pandemic made an impact on the world economy.

### Method
The website was built from scratch in Github and hosted as a Github page. The website design was kept minimalistic, with resemblance of a report. The data used for the visualization was derived from John Hopkins University (COVID-19 cases) and Yahoo Finance (financial data). I created the interactive charts using the Altair module in Python. The charts were exported as HTML code and integrated to the website, allowing for users to easily explore the information.  

### Learning Outcome
In addition to increased knowledge of working manipulating, analysing, and visualizing data in Python, this project was very educational in regards to technical capability. I learned to go from having several raw datasets to offering an interactive and informational view of that data on a website. The technologies that I learned to use in this project will prove essential for future projects relating to analyzing and visualizing data in a user friendly and accessible way.   

# PROJECT 3: Amazon - A Look at the World's Highest Valued Company 

- **Class:** Information Visualization
- **Expertise:** Communication
- **Link to project:** [Amazon - Company Dashboard Presenation](https://github.com/ehannell/dav_portfolio/blob/main/Amazon%20-%20a%20look%20at%20the%20world's%20highest%20valued%20company.pdf)

### About the project
This project, which was created for the information visualization class, is a visual presentation of the company Amazon Inc. Four Tableau dashboards are used to convey information found in the annual report, but also data from other sources, such as public sentiment derived by scraping and analyzing Twitter data.  

### Method
The initial phase of the project consisted of several design and brainstorming exercises to decide on a dashboard format that would be efficient in communicating information to the user. After deciding on a structure, I carefully selected types of visualizations that best delivered the information. These steps eventually resulted in five different dashboards, starting with a size comparison to show just how large Amazon is, followed by three dashboards holding annual report information, and finally a dashboard page to show the public perception of Amazon. On the last page I also embedded a Wikipedia page to make it possible for the user to quickly learn about company criticism.    

### Learning Outcome
This project helped me improve my ability to deliver various types of information by communicating through information visualizations. I learned how certain graphs are more suitable in conveying the underlying data, as well as how to set up the visualizations in a compelling and logical way that would help the user to understand the information. Furthermore, I was able to implement skills learned from other classes to further improve this information visualization project. For instance, I used the Python script used in the [research project](#project-1-sentiment-analysis) to analyze public perception of Amazon. 

# PROJECT 4: Thought Paper - How the Information Explosion is Disrupting Traditional Business Strategy
