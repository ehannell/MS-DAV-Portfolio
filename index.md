### About the project
This research paper was created for the final project in the data analysis class. The purpose of the paper was to investigate whether it would be possible to discern public attitude toward Tesla by analyzing data from Twitter. 

### Method
I started with building a Python script using the twitteR-module, which allowed me to scrape tweet data from Twitter. Once the connection had been set up and I had defined certain key words and criteria for defining what tweets I wanted to collect, I organized all the information into a large dataset. I imported the dataset into R, where I used the NRC-library to analyze the sentiment of each tweet. A new column was created, holding a positivity score for each tweet based on the NRC output. This column was used to determine the public sentiment toward Tesla over time. 

### Learning Outcome
Not only did I learn the fundamentals of data analysis, and especially how to analyze text based data, but this project also improved my ability to conduct and convey data driven research.
