# PROJECT 1: Sentiment Analysis

- **Class:** Data Analysis
- **Expertise:** Research
- **Link to project:** [Sentiment Analysis for Investment Research](https://github.com/ehannell/dav_portfolio/blob/main/Final%20Project%20-%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20for%20Investment%20Research%20(Erik%20Hannell).pdf)

### About the project
This research paper constitutes the final project in the **Data Analysis** class. The purpose of the project was to investigate whether it would be possible to discern public attitude toward the electrical vehicle compnany Tesla by analyzing data from Twitter, and also explore whether correlating patterns between the sentiment extracted from tweets and the share price of the company. Sentiment swings were evident upon the completion of the data analysis, but determinig share price correlation would require further statistical analysis, which falls outside the scope of this project.   

### Method
I started with building a Python script using the twitteR-module, which allowed me to scrape tweet data from Twitter. Once the connection had been set up and I had defined certain key words and criteria for defining what tweets I wanted to collect, I organized all the information into a large dataset. I imported the dataset into R, where I used the NRC-library to analyze the sentiment of each tweet. A new column was created, holding a positivity score for each tweet based on the NRC output. This column was used to determine the public sentiment toward Tesla over time. 

### Learning Outcome
Not only did I learn the fundamentals of data analysis, especially analysis of text based data, but this project also improved my ability to conduct and convey data driven research. Furthermore, I gained experience in developnig complex research questions and how to choose appropriate analytical methods for approaching those questions.    

# PROJECT 2: COVID-19 - Stock Market Impact Analysis

- **Class:** Advanced Projects
- **Expertise:** Technology
- **Link to project:** [COVID-19 - Stock Market Impact Analysis](https://ehannell.github.io/covid19_sp500/)

### About the project
This interative data visaulziation website is was built for the **Advanced Projects** class. The website consists of 6 different interactive data visualizations which shows information about the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the stock market, during the first 2-months of the virus outbreak. The purpose of the project was to make a platform that could be used by various users, regardless of financial market knowledge, to explore how the pandemic made an impact on the world economy.

### Method
The website was built from scratch in Github and hosted as a Github page. The website design was kept minimalistic, with resemblance of a report. The data used for the visualization was derived from John Hopkins University (COVID-19 cases) and Yahoo Finance (financial data). I created the interactive charts using the Altair module in Python. The charts were exported as HTML code and integrated to the website, allowing for users to easily explore the information.  

### Learning Outcome
In addition to increased knowledge of working manipulating, analysing, and visualizing data in Python, this project was very educational in regards to technical capability. I learned to go from having several raw datasets to offering an interactive and informational view of that data on a website. The technologies that I learned to use in this project will prove essential for future projects relating to analyzing and visualizing data in a user friendly and accessible way.   

# PROJECT 3: Amazon - A Look at the World's Highest Valued Company 

- **Class:** Information Visualization
- **Expertise:** Communication
- **Link to project:** [Amazon - Company Dashboard Presenation](https://github.com/ehannell/dav_portfolio/blob/main/Amazon%20-%20a%20look%20at%20the%20world's%20highest%20valued%20company.pdf)

### About the project
This project, which was created for the **Information Visualization** class, is a visual presentation of the company Amazon Inc. Four Tableau dashboards are used to convey information found in the annual report, but also data from other sources, such as public sentiment derived by scraping and analyzing Twitter data.  

### Method
The initial phase of the project consisted of several design and brainstorming exercises to decide on a dashboard format that would be efficient in communicating information to the user. After deciding on a structure, I carefully selected types of visualizations that best delivered the information. These steps eventually resulted in five different dashboards, starting with a size comparison to show just how large Amazon is, followed by three dashboards holding annual report information, and finally a dashboard page to show the public perception of Amazon. On the last page I also embedded a Wikipedia page to make it possible for the user to quickly learn about company criticism.    

### Learning Outcome
This project helped me improve my ability to deliver various types of information by communicating through information visualizations. I learned how certain graphs are more suitable in conveying the underlying data, as well as how to set up the visualizations in a compelling and logical way that would help the user to understand the information. Furthermore, I was able to implement skills learned from other classes to further improve this information visualization project. For instance, I used the Python script used in the [research project](#project-1-sentiment-analysis) to analyze public perception of Amazon. 

# PROJECT 4: Thought Paper - How the Information Explosion is Disrupting Traditional Business Strategy

- **Class:** Foundations of Information
- **Expertise:** Critical Perspectives
- **Link to project:** [Thought Paper](https://github.com/ehannell/dav_portfolio/blob/main/Foundations%20of%20Information%20-%20Thought%20Paper%20(ehannell).pdf)

![](https://i.ibb.co/C2pb8N9/thoughtpaper.jpg)

### About the project
This thought paper stands out as the least technical compared to the other projects in this portfolio. It was written as part of the **Foundations of Information** class, and seeks to explore how the information explosion of the past several decades have disrupted traditional business strategy. Coming into this master's program with a background in business, I wanted to better understand how information technology hvae changed businesses that predates the this new technological innovations.      

### Method
The thought paper is largely based on a Ted-talk by Philip Evans, the founder of the media and internet division of the global firm Boston Consulting Group (BCG). In his presentation, “How data will transform business”, Evans provides reflections very much aligned with my paper's topic. In addition to Evans’s Ted-talk, I used scholarly articles that we read in class, historical data, and other expert statements in order to yield support for the ideas presented in the paper.

### Learning Outcome
In writing this paper I learned to think critically about how constant and immediate information access shapes our society. Throughout the duration of the Foundation of Information class, we studied the information explosion's impact, for better or worse, in various areas of society. By applying the critical thinking skills gained during the course, I was able to gain a better understanding about those impacts within business strategy, a professional area that I envision myself navigating in my career. 

# PROJECT 5: User Testing Report - Socialsolar Mobile Platform

- **Class:** Usability Theory & Practice
- **Expertise:** User-Centered Design
- **Link to project:** [User Testing Report](https://github.com/ehannell/dav_portfolio/blob/main/Socialsolar.pdf)
